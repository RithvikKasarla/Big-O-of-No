**Setting up your developer environment for the backend**

First, open the terminal into the ./app/backend/ folder:
>cd Big-O-of-No/app/backend

Then, install the required node packages:
>npm install

Then initialize Prisma:
>npx prisma generate

Your developer environment is now ready, your code should be able to compile properly.

To actually start the server, use the command
>node .

Or 
>npm run start

(They do the same thing.)
